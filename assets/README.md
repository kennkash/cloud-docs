# Assets Directory

This directory contains all the static assets used in the documentation site:

## Directory Structure

- `/images/` - Contains all website images
  - Screenshot images for the documentation
  - UI element illustrations
  - Icons and graphics used throughout the site

## Image Naming Convention

- Use descriptive, kebab-case filenames
- Include the feature/section name as a prefix
- Example: `git-dashboard.jpg`, `user-management-roles.png`

## Placeholder Images

The site uses placeholder images in development. In production, replace these with actual screenshots and images.

## Adding New Images

1. Place new images in the appropriate folder
2. Use optimized images (compress them before adding)
3. Use PNG for UI screenshots and illustrations
4. Use JPG for photos
5. Use SVG for icons and simple graphics

## Icons

The site uses Font Awesome icons. Custom icons should be placed in the `/images/icons/` directory.
